# Coding-Challenge

How to use:

Run express server with:\
### 'node server.js'

Run React app with:\
### 'npm start'

Once react app is ran, it should automatically open up a webpage.

Enter comma separated urls within the first box. For example: https://i.imgur.com/zt7smR4_d.webp?maxwidth=760&fidelity=grand,https://i.imgur.com/AD3MbBi_d.webp?maxwidth=760&fidelity=grand

Optionally, we can enter a name for the file to download in the second box. If no name is given, it will default to "Output". No need to put extensions at the end like .zip. It does it automatically to zip.

Click the submit button, and a link should appear underneath the button which will allow you to download the zipped pictures!

NOTE: If you click the link too quick before the file is downloaded, it can sometimes corrupt the download. I will try to add modifications to prevent this in the future.

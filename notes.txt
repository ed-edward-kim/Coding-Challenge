________________TODO__________________
Learn more about React
Make the React frontend nicer to look at (maybe implement bootstrap?)

Edge Cases:
	Make sure number of images is more than 0, but less than 100
        Perhaps add some promise functions or awaits for the link, as it shows the link before the file actually downloads...
	


_____________Things accomplished from TODO list and their dates_______________

9/22 - Spent time learning about React and how it connects to an express server. 
9/22 - Get React and Express linked up 
9/23 - Make a diagram of the functionality
9/23 - Use Dyanmic Route with Express to take data (needs to be dynamic route due to how we call our post)
9/23 - Fixed ports not working. (Added '"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"' to package.json of React. Allows react to proxy the API req to express backend server on port 5000. Also I made sure the Express server and React server don't share the same port)
9/24 - Added this notes list to git 
9/30 - Got file handling working! Added new route for downloading file.
9/30 - Return url properly sent to react to display download site.
